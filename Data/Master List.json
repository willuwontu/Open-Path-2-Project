          "Description": "Dwarven lore tells epic tales of the short, stocky people’s long-ago pilgrimage from their Darklands home to the surface—a journey they undertook at the behest of a prophet of the god of dwarvenkind. The people reached their destination and built magnificent fortifications they came to call Sky Citadels, and many dwarves remain ensconced within these and other ancestral homes to this day. Given the dwarves’ harrowing history, their reputation as a stoic and stern people is well earned.",
          "Overview": "The dwarves’ ancient surface empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, but dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends. Dwarves are slow to trust people who are not their kin—a tendency that traces to their history of bloody conflict with foes such as giants, orcs, and the horrors of the deeps. Trust from a dwarf is hard won, but as strong as iron.\n  These sturdy people stand about a foot shorter than most humans. Long hair is often a source of pride among them, particularly when braided into intricate patterns. Men are typically broader than women, and many men take pride in their long beards. Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25 and can live to around 350 years old. \n  The distance between dwarven mountain citadels creates vast cultural divides, but many dwarves share a common passion for architecture, gem cutting, metalwork, mining, and stonework. Dwarves revere honor, justice, and the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. Few dwarves are seen without a clan dagger, a weapon forged just before an individual dwarf’s birth and bearing the gemstone of the clan. Torag, the god of dwarvenkind, is a favored dwarven deity.",

          "Description": "Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled Golarion to escape the calamity of Earthfall. Returning to a changed land, the elves have struggled to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from the terrible demons that have invaded parts of their homeland. Remnants of great elven settlements lie scattered across the Inner Sea region, and even their ancestral lands contain long-forgotten ruins and artifacts alongside newer structures.",
          "Overview": "Elves combine an otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though they fill their long years with complicated pedagogies that most shorter-lived peoples find inefficient. Elves also hold notoriously long grudges against their rivals, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendship over time.\n  Elves are generally taller than humans, and they have a fragile grace accentuated with long facial features and sharply pointed ears. Broad pupils fill their wide eyes, giving elves an alien look and allowing them to see sharply even in very little light. Elves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 20 (though they’re considered by other elves to be fully emotionally mature at close to the end of their first century), and they can live to around 600 years old.\n  Elves subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin.\n  Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they also value kindness and beauty. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic— Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.",

          "Description": "Long ago, early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it’s unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, their origin manifests in modern gnomes’ bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features that further reflect their otherworldly origins.",
          "Overview": "Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences as their progenitors did every hour of every day in the First World. The Bleaching slowly drains the literal color from gnomes, and it plunges the affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Only a very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.\n  Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh little more than a young human child. Gnomes reach physical adulthood around the age of 18, though many retain a childlike curiosity even into adulthood. Gnomes rarely live longer than 400 years.\n Though they all trace their ancestry to the First World, gnomes otherwise have little culture they point to as their own. Instead, gnomes tend to pick and choose cultural practices of the region in which they live. Gnomes claim no nation in its entirety, and as a people they wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if one existed. Most gnomes consider adventure not a choice but a necessity, and gnome adventurers often collect mementos during their travels that allow them to relive their most exciting stories.\n  Gnomes eschew order, and therefore most worship deities who value individuality and nature, such as Cayden Cailean, Desna, Gozreh, and Shelyn.",

          "Description": "It’s been almost 20 years since the end of the Goblinblood Wars that scorched the Chitterwood, forcing dozens of tribes into hiding. Now with new threats rising up, the many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that give them a chance at survival. While many have stayed to protect their homelands, others have become refugees, with some traveling to Absalom in search of a home that might offer them sanctuary in a world that does not trust them.",
          "Overview": "Even those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins’ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins’ friends consider these qualities endearing.\n  Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin’s friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance—something that a goblin does not give freely.\n  Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue. Goblin adventurers typically worship Cayden Cailean.",

Halflings use these misconceptions and prejudices to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered with caution, often leading to narrow escapes.\n  Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t naturally tend to congregate together. They have no cultural homeland, and they instead weave themselves throughout the world’s societies. Halflings usually dwell among humans within the walls of cities, eking out whatever livings they can, many performing menial labor or simple service jobs. Some halflings reject such a life, instead turning to the open road, traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.\n  Halflings rarely grow to more than 3 feet in height. Tufts of hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet, and they prefer to walk barefoot. Halflings typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to around 150 years old. Halflings are loyal to their friends and family, but they are not afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, such as Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean’s role as a liberator.\n  Halflings’ wanderlust and opportunism make them ideal adventurers, and one popular superstition even claims that traveling with a halfling is good luck.",

Though the oldest of human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem to be in a constant state of flux, as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.\n  Humans typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 18. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with other peoples, giving rise to children who bear traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs. Humans worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions.\n  For many humans, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether that end is accumulating wealth, striving for acclaim, increasing in social status, or uncovering arcane knowledge and power.",

The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting. You can create these items in two different ways, as described below. An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait.\n  First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items for which you have the formulas. Creating items in this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait. You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information). You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents. You can’t overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations. Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.",

You can usually also play an instrument for your Verbal Casting actions rather than speaking. \n  Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table on page 65.\n  Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.\n\nHeightening Spells\nWhen you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can heighten lowerlevel spells to higher levels. You must learn them at the new level to do so, as described on page 192. The spontaneous heightening class feature lets you select two spells you can heighten freely.\n\nCantrips\nSome of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1st-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.",

You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.\n  You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.

If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.\n\nSwapping Spells in Your Repertoire\nAs you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned.

You have a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast this spell. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points during your daily preparations. You can cast counter performance only by spending 1 Spell Point, not using spell slots. This power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast.\n  Some bard feats let you learn more composition powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.",

Because you’re a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol or a religious text) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don’t need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots.\n  As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Cleric Spells per Day table on page 70.\n  Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.\n\nHeightening Spells\nWhen you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell’s level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).\n\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.",

Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in parentheses after the deity’s alignment. Your deity grants you a signature skill and the trained proficiency rank with the deity’s favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. When preparing spells, you can select from these in addition to the spells on the divine list once you can cast that level of spell.\n  Select one domain—a subject of particular interest to you within the traditions of your religion—from your deity’s list of domains. This domain grants you a special kind of spell called a domain power. Each domain’s theme and powers appear in Table 3–10: Domains on page 73. By choosing a domain, you gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast domain powers. You can cast domain powers only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Your maximum number of Spell Points equals your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. You gain the initial power tied to your domain when you select the domain. Your initial domain power costs 1 Spell Point to cast and is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Domain powers are available only to characters who’ve selected the domain and can’t be learned by others.\n  Some cleric feats grant you more domain powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. You can learn additional powers, called advanced domain powers, by taking the Advanced Domain cleric feat. The Spell Point cost of this advanced domain power is listed in parentheses after its name in Table 3–10: Domains.",

        "Description": "Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Committing acts, learning or casting spells, and using items that are anathema to your deity take you out of that deity’s good graces.\n  Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn’t limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to enhance your ability to lie would be anathema to Sarenrae, as a goddess of honesty, and casting one to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death.\n  For borderline cases, you and your GM determine whether other acts count as anathema. For example, Torag is a god of community, so actions that work to destroy a close-knit community are typically anathema to Torag. However, as god of dwarves, he might permit you to destroy a community of giants that is threatening to wipe out a dwarven settlement.\n  If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include channel energy, domain powers, and divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275).",

        "Description": "Code of Conduct\nPaladins are divine champions of a deity. You must be lawful good and worship a deity that allows lawful good clerics. See the list of deities on page 72.\n  Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity’s entry. You and your GM will determine whether other acts count as anathema.\n  In addition, you must follow the paladin’s code below. Deities often add additional strictures for their own paladins (for instance, Shelyn’s paladins never attack first except to protect an innocent, and they choose and perfect an art form). \n  If you stray from lawful good, perform acts anathema to your deity, or violate your code of conduct, you lose your Spell Point pool and righteous ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275), but keep any other paladin abilities that don’t require those class features.\n\nThe Paladin’s Code\nThe following is the fundamental code all paladins follow. The tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win situation; instead, follow the most important tenet. For instance, if an evil king asked you if innocent lawbreakers were hiding in your church so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet forbidding you to lie is less important than the tenet prohibiting the harm of an innocent. An attempt to subvert the paladin code by engineering a situation allowing you to use a higher tenet to ignore a lower tenet (telling someone that you won’t respect lawful authorities so that the tenet of not lying supersedes the tenet of respecting lawful authorities, for example) is a violation of the paladin code.\n• You must never willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting an evil spell.\n• You must not use actions that you know will harm an innocent, or through inaction cause an innocent immediate harm when you knew your action could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn’t force you to take action against possible harm to innocents or to sacrifice your life and potential to attempt to protect an innocent.\n• You must act with honor, never cheating, lying, or taking advantage of others.\n• You must respect the lawful authority of the legitimate ruler or leadership in whichever land you may be, following their laws unless they violate a higher tenet.",
